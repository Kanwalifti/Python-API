The challenge was to find what is the weather like when you are approaching close to equator. The answer is obvious but to prove the obvious answer "the closer you get to equator, the hotter it gets!", I have used "OpenWeatherMap" API and "Geoapify" API. There are different analysis done based on factors such as Temperature, Cloudiness, Wind Speed and Humidity. 

Below are some analysis drawn based on the factors:
